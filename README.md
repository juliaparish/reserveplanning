# Environmental Data Science 232 Machine Learning 
## Lab 03 Assignment
### Reserve Planning

# Overview
This machine learning lab was completed as an assignment for my Masterâ€™s program course, Environmental Data Science 232: Machine Learning. It was assigned by our professor, Dr. Ben Best,

The aim of this lab is to get familiar with using the `prioritizr` R package for systematic conservation planning. It has helped with understanding the core principles of conservation planning and go through some of the common tasks involved with developing prioritizations.
